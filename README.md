# Welcome to SwapABook

SwapABook is a full-stack mobile-friendly web application built to support a love of reading!
Here users can share their bookshelves of owned, read, or reviewed books, and exchange books with other users, creating a virtual space for bibliophiles! 



This project is a full-stack web-application which allows for users to find and add books to our database and interact with them. The project utilizes Google Books API to automatically get book data and images through our embedded search functionality, as well as the SendGrid API to send user emails to validate addresses and other important functions. This application was created with HTML, BootStrap, javascript, jQuery, Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL.
